#DataSavesLives â€“ #MSCOVID19

As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds across the globe, the demand for data on the impact of the novel coronavirus on people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) grows rapidly.
This information is crucial for people with MS and clinicians to make evidence-based decisions on how to manage their condition during the pandemic or in case of a COVID-19 infection.
MS Data Alliance and the MS International Federation have teamed up to set up a Global Data Sharing Initiative and are calling for individuals and organisations across the global MS movement to get involved.  Watch our animation.
